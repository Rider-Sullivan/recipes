     <h1>How to cook pancakes</h1>
      <ol>
       <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
       <li>In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and melted butter.</li>
       <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; some lumps are okay.</li>
       <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or cooking spray.</li>
       <li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
       <li>Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
