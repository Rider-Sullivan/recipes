     <h1>How to cook lasagna</h1>
     <ol>
       <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
       <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt and cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
       <li>In a large skillet, cook ground beef over medium heat until browned. Drain excess fat. Add marinara sauce to the skillet and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
       <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, and a handful of grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well.</li>
       <li>In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom. Layer with lasagna noodles, ricotta mixture, shredded mozzarella cheese, and more meat sauce. Repeat layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and a generous topping of mozzarella cheese.</li>
       <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
       <li>Let the lasagna cool for about 15 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
